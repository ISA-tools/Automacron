###Video

You can see what our reasoning for creating this tool was, and it in action via our video.

Figure 1. AutoMacron provides a user interface (A) for domain experts to select macros from a list of computed motifs. As shown in the detailed view in (B), the overall score determines the order of motifs in the list. The three indicators are shown in unnormalized form in order to be semantically meaningful. The detail view (C) shows an example where a score is adjusted dynamically when a motif encompassing other motifs is selected. (D) shows a pop-up window for a specific macro, detailing its subgraph and three automatically generated pictograms for different levels of details in visualization.

Figure 2. We take a motif defined by the line marked A, then substitute the relevant motif with a macro that appears differently depending on the resolution a user views the workflow at.
